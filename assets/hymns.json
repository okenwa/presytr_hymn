And our eyes at last shall see Him\nThrough His own redeeming love;\nfor that Child so dear and gentle\nIs our Lord in heaven above;\nAnd He leads His children on\nTo the place where He is gone.\n\n6. Not in that poor lowly stable,\nWith the oxen standing by,\nWe shall see Him, but in heaven,\nSet at God’s right hand on high,\nWhen, like stars, His children crowned,\nAll in white shall wait around. \n\t",

Here would I feed upon the bread of God,\nHere drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven;\nHere would I lay aside each earthly load,\nHere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.\n\n3. This is the hour of banquet and of song;\nThis is the heavenly table spread for me;\nHere let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong\nThe brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.\n\n4. Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;\nThe feast, though not the love, is past and gone;\nThe bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,\nNearer than ever, still my Shield and Sun.\t\n\n5. I have no help but Thine; nor do I need\nAnother arm save Thine to lean upon;\nIt is enough, my Lord, enough indeed,\nMy strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.\n\n6. Mine is the sin, but Thine the righteousness;\nMine is the guilt, but Thine the cleansing blood;\nHere is my robe, my refuge, and my peace\nThy blood, Thy righteousness, O Lord my God.\n\n7. Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,\nYet, passing, points to the glad feast above,\nGiving sweet foretaste of the feastal joy,\nThe Lamb’s great bridal feast of bliss and love.\n",
