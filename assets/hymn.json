hardships intertwine;\nUnlike wild flowers in the field\nThat gayly, wildly bloom,\nIn countless patterns up they grow,\nFull liberty assume.\n","The flowers of the vine\nAre plain and small in size;\nSo humbly do they bloom,\nUnnoticed by most eyes.\nThe time for blossoms is so short,\nSoon into fruit they grow.\nNo charm is there for them to boast,\nNo elegance to show.\n","So fastened to a post,\nit cannot freely grow;\nUp to the trellises\nIts branches tied must go.\nFrom stony soil the vine is forced\nTo draw its food supply ;\nIt has no way to change its course,\nOr from its hardship fly.\n","How lovely is the green\nOf Spring’s beautiful scene!\nSo natural is its growth,\nWith brightness so serene.\nOut of the vine’s abundant life\nSo full and so complete,\nAgainst the azure, branches flow\nTo taste the air so sweet.\n","Behold, the master comes\nHis guidance to provide;\nThe pruning knife he brings\nTo strip it of its pride,\nNot minding all its tender shoots,\nTo cleanse and cleanse again,\nTill all excessive branches fall\nTo comply with his plan.\n","During this time of loss,\nDare it self-pity show?\nNo, no, it yields but more\nTo him who wounds it so,\nYes, to the hand that strips it of\nAll glory and all pride.\nThe vine thus keeps the strength of life\nThat much fruit may abide.\n","To hardend wood is turned\nEach stump of bleeding shoot,\nAnd each remaining branch\nBrings forth abundant fruit.\nScorched by the burning sun, its leaves\nTurn dry and fall away.\nThe fruit thus ripens more and more\nUntil the harvest day.\n","Due to the fruitful load,\nThe branches are brought low,\nThe consequence of pain\nAnd many a thoughtful blow.\nIn bearing clusters of fine fruit,\nComforted it must be;\nBut soon will come the harvest time,\nThe days of comfort flee.\n","Upon the hand-picked fruit\nComes treading of the feet.\nThe greatest treasure lies\nWhere grapes and wine-press meet.\nWhen grapes are crushed inside the press,\nRed wine begins to flow,\nLike surging rivers bringing joy\nThe earth to overflow.\n","So barren is the vine,\nIts all is spent in full,\nAnd now its plight again\nIs dreary night and woe.\nNo one would stoop to thank the vine\nFor cheering wine that’s drunk;\nInstead, more stripping is at hand\nTo make a branchless trunk.\n","Throughout the winter time,\nIts wine gives warmth, and cheers\nThe shiv’ring ones whose chill\nIs mixed with grief and tears.\nBut midst the ice and snow without,\nThe vine is thus to stand.\nWhy does it strive to bear it all?\nIt’s hard to understand.\n","When winter’s o’er, it yearns\nOnce more much fruit to bear.\nNew shoots come forth again\nTo weave its garment fair.\nIt has no murm’ring or complaint\nFor winter’s sore abuse.\nIts all it gives, and still wills not\nIts off’ring to reduce.\n","It stretches up toward heav’n,\nAnd breathes the fresh clean air.\nUntouched by earthly joy,\nSelf-love it does not bear.\nIt smiles at sacrifice ahead,\nAccepting odds once more;\nAs if no strokes, no stripping sore\nCan it ever recall.\n","Much sap and wine and blood\nOut from its branches flow.\nDoes emptying itself\nCause it more poor to grow?\nFrom it, drunkards and wanderers\nDo drink and merry make.\nDo they, from pleasure much, become\nMore wealthy when they wake?\n","Measure your life by loss,\nnever measure by gain;\nNot by much wine consumed,\nBut wine poured out in pain.\nThe strength of love stands ever in\nLove’s sacrifice to show.\nThe more one suffers, then the more\nTrue love can he bestow.\n","He who spares not himself\nIs best for God to gain;\nWho hurts himself the most\nCan best soothe those in pain.\nUnless well-learned in being stripped,\nA sounding brass is he.\nUnless averse to saving self,\nNe’er can he blissful be.\n"]},{"num":"401","title":"LEAD, LEAD ME TO CALVARY","stanza":["Lead, lead me to Calvary -\nThere where Jesus died for me,\nDespised by men and forsaken by God,\nSuffered of His
